## About

This portfolio website was designed with minimalism in mind; simplicity at it's best; 
it also has an innate sense of humour which may be a little bit tangy especially to humour averse beings. Beware

However it also showcases my prowess and ability to merge different technologies to create a creation so beautiful it rivals an apple product in mimicry.
